    "keywords": "LINQ to DB LINQ to DB is the fastest LINQ database access library offering a simple, light, fast, and type-safe layer between your POCO objects and your database. Architecturally it is one step above micro-ORMs like Dapper, Massive, or PetaPoco, in that you work with LINQ expressions, not with magic strings, while maintaining a thin abstraction layer between your code and the database. Your queries are checked by the C# compiler and allow for easy refactoring. However, it's not as heavy as LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework. There is no change-tracking, so you have to manage that yourself, but on the plus side you get more control and faster access to your data. In other words LINQ to DB is type-safe SQL .

Project Build Status Appveyor Travis master latest Feeds NuGet MyGet V2 https://www.myget.org/F/linq2db/api/v2 V3 https://www.myget.org/F/linq2db/api/v3/index.json Let's get started From NuGet : Install-Package linq2db - .Net Install-Package linq2db.core - .Net Core Configuring connection strings .Net In your web.config or app.config make sure you have a connection string: <connectionStrings> <add name=\"Northwind\" connectionString = \"Server=.\\;Database=Northwind;Trusted_Connection=True;Enlist=False;\" providerName = \"SqlServer\" /> </connectionStrings> .Net Core .Net Core does not support System.Configuration so to configure connection strings you should implement ILinqToDBSettings , for example: public class ConnectionStringSettings : IConnectionStringSettings { public string ConnectionString { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public string ProviderName { get; set; } public bool IsGlobal => false; } public class MySettings : ILinqToDBSettings { public IEnumerable<IDataProviderSettings> DataProviders { get { yield break; } } public string DefaultConfiguration => \"SqlServer\"; public string DefaultDataProvider => \"SqlServer\"; public IEnumerable<IConnectionStringSettings> ConnectionStrings { get { yield return new ConnectionStringSettings { Name = \"SqlServer\", ProviderName = \"SqlServer\", ConnectionString = @\"Server=.\\;Database=Northwind;Trusted_Connection=True;Enlist=False;\" }; } } } And later just set: DataConnection.DefaultSettings = new MySettings(); You can also use same for regular .Net Now let's create a POCO class: using System; using LinqToDB.Mapping; [Table(Name = \"Products\")] public class Product { [PrimaryKey, Identity] public int ProductID { get; set; } [Column(Name = \"ProductName\"), NotNull] public string Name { get; set; } // ... other columns ... } At this point LINQ to DB doesn't know how to connect to our database or which POCOs go with what database. All this mapping is done through a DataConnection class: public class DbNorthwind : LinqToDB.Data.DataConnection { public DbNorthwind() : base(\"Northwind\") { } public ITable<Product> Product { get { return GetTable<Product>(); } } public ITable<Category> Category { get { return GetTable<Category>(); } } // ... other tables ... } We call the base constructor with the \"Northwind\" parameter. This parameter has to match the name=\"Northwind\" we defined above in our connection string. We also have to register our Product class we defined above to allows us to write LINQ queries. And now let's get some data: using LinqToDB; using LinqToDB.Common; public static List<Product> All() { using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { var query = from p in db.Product where p.ProductID > 25 orderby p.Name descending select p; return query.ToList(); } } Make sure you always wrap your DataConnection class (in our case DbNorthwind ) in a using statement. This is required for proper resource management, like releasing the database connections back into the pool. Details Selecting Columns Most times we get the entire row from the database: from p in db.Product where p.ProductID == 5 select p; However, sometimes getting all the fields is too wasteful so we want only certain fields, but still use our POCOs; something that is challenging for libraries that rely on object tracking, like LINQ to SQL. from p in db.Product orderby p.Name descending select new Product { Name = p.Name }; Composing queries Rather than concatenating strings we can 'compose' LINQ expressions. In the example below the final SQL will be different if onlyActive is true or false, or if searchFor is not null. public static List<Product> All(bool onlyActive, string searchFor) { using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { var products = from p in db.Product select p; if (onlyActive) { products = from p in products where !p.Discontinued select p; } if (searchFor != null) { products = from p in products where p.Name.Contains(searchFor) select p; } return products.ToList(); } } Paging A lot of times we need to write code that returns only a subset of the entire dataset. We expand on the previous example to show what a product search function could look like. Keep in mind that the code below will query the database twice. Once to find out the total number of records, something that is required by many paging controls, and once to return the actual data. public static List<Product> Search(string searchFor, int currentPage, int pageSize, out int totalRecords) { using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { var products = from p in db.Product select p; if (searchFor != null) { products = from p in products where p.Name.Contains(searchFor) select p; } totalRecords = products.Count(); return products.Skip((currentPage - 1) * pageSize).Take(pageSize).ToList(); } } Joins This assumes we added a Category class, just like we did with the Product class, defined all the fields, and registered it in our DbNorthwind data access class. We can now write an INNER JOIN query like this: from p in db.Product join c in db.Category on p.CategoryID equals c.CategoryID select new Product { Name = p.Name, Category = c }; and a LEFT JOIN query like this: from p in db.Product from c in db.Category.Where(q => q.CategoryID == p.CategoryID).DefaultIfEmpty() select new Product { Name = p.Name, Category = c }; Creating your POCOs In the previous example we assign an entire Category object to our product, but what if we want all the fields in our Product class, but we don't want to specify every field by hand? Unfortunately, we cannot write this: from p in db.Product from c in db.Category.Where(q => q.CategoryID == p.CategoryID).DefaultIfEmpty() select new Product(c); The query above assumes the Product class has a constructor that takes in a Category object. The query above won't work, but we can work around that with the following query: from p in db.Product from c in db.Category.Where(q => q.CategoryID == p.CategoryID).DefaultIfEmpty() select Product.Build(p, c); For this to work, we need a function in the Product class that looks like this: public static Product Build(Product product, Category category) { if (product != null) { product.Category = category; } return product; } One caveat with this approach is that if you're using it with composed queries (see example above) the select Build part has to come only in the final select. Insert At some point we will need to add a new Product to the database. One way would be to call the Insert extension method found in the LinqToDB namespace; so make sure you import that. using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { db.Insert(product); } This inserts all the columns from our Product class, but without retrieving the generated identity value. To do that we can use InsertWithIdentity , like this: using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { product.ProductID = Convert.ToInt32(db.InsertWithIdentity(product)); } We need to convert the returned value to an integer since an identity field could be something other than an integer, like a GUID for example. There is also InsertOrReplace that updates a database record if found or adds it otherwise. If you need to insert only certain fields, or use values generated by the database, you could write: using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { db.Product .Value(p => p.Name, product.Name) .Value(p => p.UnitPrice, 10.2m) .Value(p => p.Added, () => Sql.CurrentTimestamp) .Insert(); } Using this method also allows us to build insert statements like this: using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { var statement = db.Product .Value(p => p.Name, product.Name) .Value(p => p.UnitPrice, 10.2m); if (storeAdded) statement.Value(p => p.Added, () => Sql.CurrentTimestamp); statement.Insert(); } Update Updating records follows a similar pattern to Insert. We have an extension method that updates all the columns in the database: using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { db.Update(product); } And we also have a lower level update mechanism: using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { db.Product .Where(p => p.ProductID == product.ProductID) .Set(p => p.Name, product.Name) .Set(p => p.UnitPrice, product.UnitPrice) .Update(); } Similarly, we can break an update query into multiple pieces if needed: using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { var statement = db.Product .Where(p => p.ProductID == product.ProductID) .Set(p => p.Name, product.Name); if (updatePrice) statement = statement.Set(p => p.UnitPrice, product.UnitPrice); statement.Update(); } You're not limited to updating a single field. For example, we could discontinue all the products that are no longer in stock: using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { db.Product .Where(p => p.UnitsInStock == 0) .Set(p => p.Discontinued, true) .Update(); } Delete Similar to how you update records, you can also delete records: using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { db.Product .Where(p => p.Discontinued) .Delete(); } Bulk Copy Bulk copy feature supports the transfer of large amounts of data into a table from another data source. For faster data inserting DO NOT use a transaction. If you use a transaction an adhoc implementation of the bulk copy feature has been added in order to insert multiple lines at once. You get faster results then inserting lines one by one, but it's still slower than the database provider bulk copy. So, DO NOT use transactions whenever you can (Take care of unicity constraints, primary keys, etc. since bulk copy ignores them at insertion) [Table(Name = \"ProductsTemp\")] public class ProductTemp { public int ProductID { get; set; } [Column(Name = \"ProductName\"), NotNull] public string Name { get; set; } // ... other columns ... } list = List<ProductTemp> using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { db.BulkCopy(list); } Transactions Using database transactions is easy. All you have to do is call BeginTransaction() on your DataConnection, run one or more queries, and then commit the changes by calling CommitTransaction(). If something happened and you need to roll back your changes you can either call RollbackTransaction() or throw an exception. using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { db.BeginTransaction(); // ... select / insert / update / delete ... if (somethingIsNotRight) { db.RollbackTransaction(); } else { db.CommitTransaction(); } } Also, you can use .NET built-in TransactionScope class: // don't forget isolation level is serializable by default using (var transaction = new TransactionScope()) { using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { ... } transaction.Complete(); } MiniProfiler If you would like to use MiniProfiler from StackExchange you'd need to wrap ProfiledDbConnection around our regular DataConnection. public class DbDataContext : DataConnection { #if !DEBUG public DbDataContext() : base(\"Northwind\") { } #else public DbDataContext() : base(GetDataProvider(), GetConnection()) { } private static IDataProvider GetDataProvider() { return new SqlServerDataProvider(\"\", SqlServerVersion.v2012); } private static IDbConnection GetConnection() { LinqToDB.Common.Configuration.AvoidSpecificDataProviderAPI = true; var dbConnection = new SqlConnection(@\"Server=.\\SQL;Database=Northwind;Trusted_Connection=True;Enlist=False;\"); return new StackExchange.Profiling.Data.ProfiledDbConnection(dbConnection, MiniProfiler.Current); } #endif } This assumes that you only want to use MiniProfiler while in DEBUG mode and that you are using SQL Server for your database. If you're using a different database you would need to change GetDataProvider() to return the appropriate IDataProvider. For example, if using MySql you would use: private static IDataProvider GetDataProvider() { return new LinqToDB.DataProvider.MySql.MySqlDataProvider(); } Links Blog LINQ to DB NuGets LINQ to DB pre release NuGets LINQ to DB on GitHub Source Code Code Examples"

    "keywords": "Managing data connection .NET database providers use connection pooling to work with database connections, where they take connection from pool, use it, and then release connection back to connection pool so it could be reused. When connection is not released correctly after use, connection pool will consider it still used, which will lead to two consequesnces: your application will create more and more connections to database, because there are no free connections to reuse from connection pool manager point of view at some point your application will fail to obtain connection from pool, because pool size limit reached To avoid collection leaks you should care about how you are creating and disposing connections. There are to ways to query database with linq2db: using DataConnection class. Using DataConnection you can make several queries in one physical database connection, so you do not have overhead on opening and closing database connection. You should follow few simple rules: always dispose DataConnection instance (it is recommended to use using c# statement); query should be executed before DataConnection object is disposed. From version 1.8.0 we have introduced protection from wrong usage, and you will get ObjectDisposedException trying to perform query on disposed DataConnection instance. using DataContext class. DataContext opens and closes physical connection for each query! Be careful with DataContext.KeepConnectionAlive property, if you set it true , it would work the same way as DataConnection ! So we do not recommend you to set this property to true . Done right using (var db = new DataConnection()) { // your code here } public IEnumerable<Person> GetPersons() { using (var db = new DataConnection()) { // ToList call sends query to database while we are still in using return db.GetTable<Person>().ToList(); } } public IEnumerable<Person> GetPersons() { // ToList call sends query to database and DataContext releases connection return new DataContext().GetTable<Person>().ToList(); } public IQuerable<Person> GetPersons() { // query is not sent to database here // it will be executed later when user will enumerate results of method // but DataContext will handle it properly return new DataContext().GetTable<Person>(); } public async Task<IEnumerable<Person>> GetPersons() { using (var db = new DataConnection()) { // await will suspend execution inside of using waiting for query results from ToListAsync() // after that execution will continue and dispose `DataConnection` instance return await db.GetTable<Person>().ToListAsync(); } } Done wrong public IEnumerable<Person> GetPersons() { using (var db = new DataConnection()) { // query will be executed only when user will enumerate method results return db.GetTable<Person>(); } } // DataConnection already disposed here // starting from linq2db 1.8.0 it will fail with ObjectDisposedException // versions prior to 1.8.0 will execute query (if there are free connectons left) and will create leaked connection var persons = GetPersons().ToList(); public async Task<IEnumerable<Person>> GetPersons() { using (var db = new DataConnection()) { // no suspension point here, awaitable task will be returned immediately from method // creating race conditions return db.GetTable<Person>().ToListAsync(); } } // query execution will be called on disposed DataConnection var persons = await GetPersons();"

LINKING EXCEPTION In addition to the permissions in the GNU General Public License, the authors give you unlimited permission to link the compiled version of this library into combinations with other programs, and to distribute those combinations without any restriction coming from the use of this file. (The General Public License restrictions do apply in other respects; for example, they cover modification of the file, and distribution when not linked into a combined executable.) GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. The hypothetical commands show w' and show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than show w' and show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.] Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.

If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    "title": "LINQ to DB | Linq To DB (aka linq2db)",
    "keywords": "LINQ to DB LINQ to DB is the fastest LINQ database access library offering a simple, light, fast, and type-safe layer between your POCO objects and your database. Architecturally it is one step above micro-ORMs like Dapper, Massive, or PetaPoco, in that you work with LINQ expressions, not with magic strings, while maintaining a thin abstraction layer between your code and the database. Your queries are checked by the C# compiler and allow for easy refactoring. However, it's not as heavy as LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework. There is no change-tracking, so you have to manage that yourself, but on the plus side you get more control and faster access to your data. In other words LINQ to DB is type-safe SQL . Visit our blog and see Wiki for more details. Code examples and demos can be found here . How to help the project No, this is not the donate link. We do need something really more valuable - your time . If you really want to help us please read this post . Project Build Status Appveyor Travis master latest Feeds NuGet MyGet V2 https://www.myget.org/F/linq2db/api/v2 V3 https://www.myget.org/F/linq2db/api/v3/index.json Let's get started From NuGet : Install-Package linq2db - .Net Install-Package linq2db.core - .Net Core Configuring connection strings .Net In your web.config or app.config make sure you have a connection string: <connectionStrings> <add name=\"Northwind\" connectionString = \"Server=.\\;Database=Northwind;Trusted_Connection=True;Enlist=False;\" providerName = \"SqlServer\" /> </connectionStrings> .Net Core .Net Core does not support System.Configuration so to configure connection strings you should implement ILinqToDBSettings , for example: public class ConnectionStringSettings : IConnectionStringSettings { public string ConnectionString { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public string ProviderName { get; set; } public bool IsGlobal => false; } public class MySettings : ILinqToDBSettings { public IEnumerable<IDataProviderSettings> DataProviders { get { yield break; } } public string DefaultConfiguration => \"SqlServer\"; public string DefaultDataProvider => \"SqlServer\"; public IEnumerable<IConnectionStringSettings> ConnectionStrings { get { yield return new ConnectionStringSettings { Name = \"SqlServer\", ProviderName = \"SqlServer\", ConnectionString = @\"Server=.\\;Database=Northwind;Trusted_Connection=True;Enlist=False;\" }; } } } And later just set: DataConnection.DefaultSettings = new MySettings(); You can also use same for regular .Net Now let's create a POCO class: using System; using LinqToDB.Mapping; [Table(Name = \"Products\")] public class Product { [PrimaryKey, Identity] public int ProductID { get; set; } [Column(Name = \"ProductName\"), NotNull] public string Name { get; set; } // ... other columns ... } At this point LINQ to DB doesn't know how to connect to our database or which POCOs go with what database. All this mapping is done through a DataConnection class: public class DbNorthwind : LinqToDB.Data.DataConnection { public DbNorthwind() : base(\"Northwind\") { } public ITable<Product> Product { get { return GetTable<Product>(); } } public ITable<Category> Category { get { return GetTable<Category>(); } } // ... other tables ... } We call the base constructor with the \"Northwind\" parameter. This parameter has to match the name=\"Northwind\" we defined above in our connection string. We also have to register our Product class we defined above to allows us to write LINQ queries. And now let's get some data: using LinqToDB; using LinqToDB.Common; public static List<Product> All() { using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { var query = from p in db.Product where p.ProductID > 25 orderby p.Name descending select p; return query.ToList(); } } Make sure you always wrap your DataConnection class (in our case DbNorthwind ) in a using statement. This is required for proper resource management, like releasing the database connections back into the pool. Details Selecting Columns Most times we get the entire row from the database: from p in db.Product where p.ProductID == 5 select p; However, sometimes getting all the fields is too wasteful so we want only certain fields, but still use our POCOs; something that is challenging for libraries that rely on object tracking, like LINQ to SQL. from p in db.Product orderby p.Name descending select new Product { Name = p.Name }; Composing queries Rather than concatenating strings we can 'compose' LINQ expressions. In the example below the final SQL will be different if onlyActive is true or false, or if searchFor is not null. public static List<Product> All(bool onlyActive, string searchFor) { using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { var products = from p in db.Product select p; if (onlyActive) { products = from p in products where !p.Discontinued select p; } if (searchFor != null) { products = from p in products where p.Name.Contains(searchFor) select p; } return products.ToList(); } } Paging A lot of times we need to write code that returns only a subset of the entire dataset. We expand on the previous example to show what a product search function could look like. Keep in mind that the code below will query the database twice. Once to find out the total number of records, something that is required by many paging controls, and once to return the actual data. public static List<Product> Search(string searchFor, int currentPage, int pageSize, out int totalRecords) { using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { var products = from p in db.Product select p; if (searchFor != null) { products = from p in products where p.Name.Contains(searchFor) select p; } totalRecords = products.Count(); return products.Skip((currentPage - 1) * pageSize).Take(pageSize).ToList(); } } Joins This assumes we added a Category class, just like we did with the Product class, defined all the fields, and registered it in our DbNorthwind data access class. We can now write an INNER JOIN query like this: from p in db.Product join c in db.Category on p.CategoryID equals c.CategoryID select new Product { Name = p.Name, Category = c }; and a LEFT JOIN query like this: from p in db.Product from c in db.Category.Where(q => q.CategoryID == p.CategoryID).DefaultIfEmpty() select new Product { Name = p.Name, Category = c }; Creating your POCOs In the previous example we assign an entire Category object to our product, but what if we want all the fields in our Product class, but we don't want to specify every field by hand? Unfortunately, we cannot write this: from p in db.Product from c in db.Category.Where(q => q.CategoryID == p.CategoryID).DefaultIfEmpty() select new Product(c); The query above assumes the Product class has a constructor that takes in a Category object. The query above won't work, but we can work around that with the following query: from p in db.Product from c in db.Category.Where(q => q.CategoryID == p.CategoryID).DefaultIfEmpty() select Product.Build(p, c); For this to work, we need a function in the Product class that looks like this: public static Product Build(Product product, Category category) { if (product != null) { product.Category = category; } return product; } One caveat with this approach is that if you're using it with composed queries (see example above) the select Build part has to come only in the final select. Insert At some point we will need to add a new Product to the database. One way would be to call the Insert extension method found in the LinqToDB namespace; so make sure you import that. using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { db.Insert(product); } This inserts all the columns from our Product class, but without retrieving the generated identity value. To do that we can use InsertWithIdentity , like this: using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { product.ProductID = Convert.ToInt32(db.InsertWithIdentity(product)); } We need to convert the returned value to an integer since an identity field could be something other than an integer, like a GUID for example. There is also InsertOrReplace that updates a database record if found or adds it otherwise. If you need to insert only certain fields, or use values generated by the database, you could write: using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { db.Product .Value(p => p.Name, product.Name) .Value(p => p.UnitPrice, 10.2m) .Value(p => p.Added, () => Sql.CurrentTimestamp) .Insert(); } Using this method also allows us to build insert statements like this: using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { var statement = db.Product .Value(p => p.Name, product.Name) .Value(p => p.UnitPrice, 10.2m); if (storeAdded) statement.Value(p => p.Added, () => Sql.CurrentTimestamp); statement.Insert(); } Update Updating records follows a similar pattern to Insert. We have an extension method that updates all the columns in the database: using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { db.Update(product); } And we also have a lower level update mechanism: using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { db.Product .Where(p => p.ProductID == product.ProductID) .Set(p => p.Name, product.Name) .Set(p => p.UnitPrice, product.UnitPrice) .Update(); } Similarly, we can break an update query into multiple pieces if needed: using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { var statement = db.Product .Where(p => p.ProductID == product.ProductID) .Set(p => p.Name, product.Name); if (updatePrice) statement = statement.Set(p => p.UnitPrice, product.UnitPrice); statement.Update(); } You're not limited to updating a single field. For example, we could discontinue all the products that are no longer in stock: using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { db.Product .Where(p => p.UnitsInStock == 0) .Set(p => p.Discontinued, true) .Update(); } Delete Similar to how you update records, you can also delete records: using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { db.Product .Where(p => p.Discontinued) .Delete(); } Bulk Copy Bulk copy feature supports the transfer of large amounts of data into a table from another data source. For faster data inserting DO NOT use a transaction. If you use a transaction an adhoc implementation of the bulk copy feature has been added in order to insert multiple lines at once. You get faster results then inserting lines one by one, but it's still slower than the database provider bulk copy. So, DO NOT use transactions whenever you can (Take care of unicity constraints, primary keys, etc. since bulk copy ignores them at insertion) [Table(Name = \"ProductsTemp\")] public class ProductTemp { public int ProductID { get; set; } [Column(Name = \"ProductName\"), NotNull] public string Name { get; set; } // ... other columns ... } list = List<ProductTemp> using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { db.BulkCopy(list); } Transactions Using database transactions is easy. All you have to do is call BeginTransaction() on your DataConnection, run one or more queries, and then commit the changes by calling CommitTransaction(). If something happened and you need to roll back your changes you can either call RollbackTransaction() or throw an exception. using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { db.BeginTransaction(); // ... select / insert / update / delete ... if (somethingIsNotRight) { db.RollbackTransaction(); } else { db.CommitTransaction(); } } Also, you can use .NET built-in TransactionScope class: // don't forget isolation level is serializable by default using (var transaction = new TransactionScope()) { using (var db = new DbNorthwind()) { ... } transaction.Complete(); } MiniProfiler If you would like to use MiniProfiler from StackExchange you'd need to wrap ProfiledDbConnection around our regular DataConnection. public class DbDataContext : DataConnection { #if !DEBUG public DbDataContext() : base(\"Northwind\") { } #else public DbDataContext() : base(GetDataProvider(), GetConnection()) { } private static IDataProvider GetDataProvider() { return new SqlServerDataProvider(\"\", SqlServerVersion.v2012); } private static IDbConnection GetConnection() { LinqToDB.Common.Configuration.AvoidSpecificDataProviderAPI = true; var dbConnection = new SqlConnection(@\"Server=.\\SQL;Database=Northwind;Trusted_Connection=True;Enlist=False;\"); return new StackExchange.Profiling.Data.ProfiledDbConnection(dbConnection, MiniProfiler.Current); } #endif } This assumes that you only want to use MiniProfiler while in DEBUG mode and that you are using SQL Server for your database. If you're using a different database you would need to change GetDataProvider() to return the appropriate IDataProvider. For example, if using MySql you would use: private static IDataProvider GetDataProvider() { return new LinqToDB.DataProvider.MySql.MySqlDataProvider(); }"

But you also should care about other supported platforms. To check if your changes have not affected other projects you can: run .\\Source\\compile.cmd - builds .Net 4, .Net 4.5, .Net WS run dotnet build - in Root folder to build .Net Core ## Different platforms support Because of compiling for different platforms we do use: Conditional compilation. Different projects and configurations define compilation symbols: FW4 - .Net 4.0 compatibility level SILVERLIGHT - Silverlight compatibility level NETFX_CORE - Windows Store 8 compatibility level NOASYNC - async is not supported NETSTANDARD - .Net Core (netstandard1.6) compatibility level NOFSHARP - used by .Net Core test project to avoid compiling code dependent on F# Exclude files from build - some files are excluded from build in projects, corresponding to target framework Implementing missing classes and enums. There are some under .\\Source\\Compatibility folder. ## Run tests NUnit3 is used as unit testing framework. Most tests are run for all supported databases, and written in same pattern: ```cs [TestFixture] public class Test: TestBase // TestBase - base class, provides base methods and object data sources { // DataContextSourceAttribute - implements Nunit ITestBuilder and provides context values to test [DataContextSource] public void Test(string context) { // TestBase.GetDataContext - creates new IDataContext, supports creating WCF client and server using(var db = GetDataContext(context)) { // Here is the most interesting // this.Person - list of persons, corresponding Person table in database (derived from TestBase) // db.Person - database table // So test checks that LINQ to Objects query produces the same result as executed database query AreEqual(this.Person.Where( => .Name == \"John\"), db.Person.Where( => .Name == \"John\")); } } } ### Configure data providers for tests `DataContextSourceAttribute` generates tests for each configured data provider, configuration is taken: 1. From `.\\Tests\\Linq\\UserDataProviders.txt` (if any) (UserDataProviders.Core.txt for .Net Core) 1. From `.\\Tests\\Linq\\DefaultDataProviders.txt` (DefaultDataProviders.Core.txt for .Net Core) All default connection strings are stored in `.\\Tests\\Linq\\app.config` `DataProviders.txt` structure is: `[!]ConfigurationName[* ConnectionString][* DataProviderName]` * `[]` - optional parts * `*` - is used as field delimiter * `--` - is used to comment line Parts: * `!` - means that this configuration is used as `DataConnection.DefaultConfiguration` * `ConfigurationName` - configuration name (passed to test as `context` parameter) * ConnectionString - used to override default connection string from `app.config` * DataProviderName - used to define DataProvider for configuration **UserDataProviders.txt example** -- this is comment line and would be ignored Access !SQLiteMs * Data Source=Database\\TestData.sqlite * SQLite this does mean: * Run tests for `Access` configuration with default settings * Run tests for `SQLiteMs` configuration. This configuration is used as default, with connection string `Data Source=Database\\TestData.sqlite` and `SQLite` data provider. More examples are below in CI section. So tests are done only for providers defined in `DataProviders.txt`, defaults are in `DefaultDataProviders.txt` (they are Access, SQL CE, SQLite - all file server databases). To define your own configurations **DO NOT EDIT** `DefaultDataProviders.txt` - create `.\\Tests\\Linq\\UserDataProviders.txt` and define needed configurations. When all tests are executed, first `_CreateData` tests will be run - those execute SQL scripts and insert default data to database, so if you are going to run one test be sure to run `_CreateData` before it manually. Also - if your test changes database data, be sure to revert those changes (!) to avoid side effects for other tests. # Continuous Integration We do run builds and tests with: * [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/igor-tkachev/linq2db) (Windows) [appveyor.yml](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/appveyor.yml). Makes build and runs tests for: * .Net 4.5: [AppveyorDataProviders.txt](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/Tests/Linq/AppveyorDataProviders.txt) * .Net Core: [AppveyorDataProviders.Core.txt](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/Tests/Linq/AppveyorDataProviders.Core.txt) * [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/linq2db/linq2db) (Linux) [.travis.yml](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/.travis.yml). Makes build and runs tests for: * Mono: [TravisDataProviders.txt](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/Tests/Linq/TravisDataProviders.txt) * .Net Core: [TravisDataProviders.Core.txt](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/Tests/Linq/TravisDataProviders.Core.txt) `xxxDataproviders` files are renamed by CI to `UserDataProviders` before running tests. ## Skip CI build If you want to skip building commit by CI (for example you have changed *.md files only) begin commit comment with `[ci skip]`. ## Publishing packages * **Release candidate** packages are published by AppVeyor to [MyGet.org](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db#feeds) for each successful build of **master** branch. * **Release** packages are published by AppVeyor to [NuGet.org](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db#feeds) for each successful build of **release** branch. ## Building releases 1. Update `.\\NuGet\\Readme.txt` file (append release notes) 1. Create PR from `master` to `release` branch, in comments add [@testers](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/wiki/How-can-i-help#testing-how-to) to notify all testers that we are ready to release 1. Wait few days for feedback from testers and approval from contributors 1. Merge PR 1. [Tag release](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/releases) 1. Update versions in `master` branch (this will lead to publish all next `master` builds as new version RC): * in [.\\appveyor.yml](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/appveyor.yml) set `packageVersion` parameter * in [.\\Source\\project.json](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/Source/project.json) set new `version` parameter * in [.\\Source\\Properties\\LinqToDBConstants.cs](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/Source/Properties/LinqToDBConstants.cs) set `FullVersionString` constant. # Process In general you should follow simple rules: * Development rules and regulations, code style * Do not add new features without tests * Avoid direct pushes to `master` and `release` branches * To fix some issue or implement new feature create new branch and make pull request after you are ready to merge. Merge your PR only after contributor's review. * If you are going to implement any big feature you may want other contributors to participate (coding, code review, feature discuss and so on), so to do it: * Create new PR with **[WIP]** prefix (Work In Process) * After you are ready to merge remove the prefix & assign contributors as reviewers * If you wo have wright access, it is recommended to use central repository (not forks). Why - simple, it would allow other teammates to help you in developing (if needed). Certainly you are free to use fork if it is more convenient to you * Please avoid adding new public classes, properties, methods without XML doc * Read issues and help users * Do not EF :)"

    "keywords": "Starting from version 1.8.0, linq2db supports Window Functions also known as Analytic Functions. Implementation is based on Oracle's Documentation and all mentioned functions are supported. Window functions are implemented as extension methods for static Sql.Ext property. For defining Partitioning and Ordering fluent syntax is used and it is closest as possible to original SQL syntax. C# Syntax: Sql.Ext.[Function]([Parameters]).Over().[PartitionPart].[OrderByPart].[WindowingPart].ToValue() Last function in method chain must be function ToValue() - it is a mark that method chain is finished and provides correct DataType for resulting columns. Example: var q = from p in db.Parent join c in db.Child on p.ParentID equals c.ParentID select new { Rank = Sql.Ext.Rank().Over().PartitionBy(p.Value1, c.ChildID).OrderBy(p.Value1).ThenBy(c.ChildID).ThenBy(c.ParentID).ToValue(), RowNumber = Sql.Ext.RowNumber().Over().PartitionBy(p.Value1, c.ChildID).OrderByDesc(p.Value1).ThenBy(c.ChildID).ThenByDesc(c.ParentID).ToValue(), DenseRank = Sql.Ext.DenseRank().Over().PartitionBy(p.Value1, c.ChildID).OrderBy(p.Value1).ToValue(), Sum = Sql.Ext.Sum(p.Value1).Over().PartitionBy(p.Value1, c.ChildID).OrderBy(p.Value1).ToValue(), Avg = Sql.Ext.Average<double>(p.Value1).Over().PartitionBy(p.Value1, c.ChildID).OrderBy(p.Value1).ToValue(), Count = Sql.Ext.Count(p.ParentID, Sql.AggregateModifier.All) .Over() .PartitionBy(p.Value1) .OrderBy(p.Value1).Range.Between.UnboundedPreceding.And.CurrentRow.ToValue(), }; var res = q.ToArray(); Resulting SQL: SELECT RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY [p].[Value1], [c7].[ChildID] ORDER BY [p].[Value1], [c7].[ChildID], [c7].[ParentID]) as [c1], ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY [p].[Value1], [c7].[ChildID] ORDER BY [p].[Value1] DESC, [c7].[ChildID], [c7].[ParentID] DESC) as [c2], DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY [p].[Value1], [c7].[ChildID] ORDER BY [p].[Value1]) as [c3], SUM([p].[Value1]) OVER(PARTITION BY [p].[Value1], [c7].[ChildID] ORDER BY [p].[Value1]) as [c4], AVG([p].[Value1]) OVER(PARTITION BY [p].[Value1], [c7].[ChildID] ORDER BY [p].[Value1]) as [c5], COUNT(ALL [p].[ParentID]) OVER(PARTITION BY [p].[Value1] ORDER BY [p].[Value1] RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as [c6] FROM [Parent] [p] INNER JOIN [Child] [c7] ON [p].[ParentID] = [c7].[ParentID] Note There is no limitation in window functions usage.

But you also should care about other supported platforms. To check if your changes have not affected other projects you can: run .\\Source\\compile.cmd - builds .Net 4, .Net 4.5, .Net WS run dotnet build - in Root folder to build .Net Core ## Different platforms support Because of compiling for different platforms we do use: Conditional compilation. Different projects and configurations define compilation symbols: FW4 - .Net 4.0 compatibility level SILVERLIGHT - Silverlight compatibility level NETFX_CORE - Windows Store 8 compatibility level NOASYNC - async is not supported NETSTANDARD - .Net Core (netstandard1.6) compatibility level NOFSHARP - used by .Net Core test project to avoid compiling code dependent on F# Exclude files from build - some files are excluded from build in projects, corresponding to target framework Implementing missing classes and enums. There are some under .\\Source\\Compatibility folder. ## Run tests NUnit3 is used as unit testing framework. Most tests are run for all supported databases, and written in same pattern: ```cs [TestFixture] public class Test: TestBase // TestBase - base class, provides base methods and object data sources { // DataContextSourceAttribute - implements Nunit ITestBuilder and provides context values to test [DataContextSource] public void Test(string context) { // TestBase.GetDataContext - creates new IDataContext, supports creating WCF client and server using(var db = GetDataContext(context)) { // Here is the most interesting // this.Person - list of persons, corresponding Person table in database (derived from TestBase) // db.Person - database table // So test checks that LINQ to Objects query produces the same result as executed database query AreEqual(this.Person.Where( => .Name == \"John\"), db.Person.Where( => .Name == \"John\")); } } } ### Configure data providers for tests `DataContextSourceAttribute` generates tests for each configured data provider, configuration is taken: 1. From `.\\Tests\\Linq\\UserDataProviders.txt` (if any) (UserDataProviders.Core.txt for .Net Core) 1. From `.\\Tests\\Linq\\DefaultDataProviders.txt` (DefaultDataProviders.Core.txt for .Net Core) All default connection strings are stored in `.\\Tests\\Linq\\app.config` `DataProviders.txt` structure is: `[!]ConfigurationName[* ConnectionString][* DataProviderName]` * `[]` - optional parts * `*` - is used as field delimiter * `--` - is used to comment line Parts: * `!` - means that this configuration is used as `DataConnection.DefaultConfiguration` * `ConfigurationName` - configuration name (passed to test as `context` parameter) * ConnectionString - used to override default connection string from `app.config` * DataProviderName - used to define DataProvider for configuration **UserDataProviders.txt example** -- this is comment line and would be ignored Access !SQLiteMs * Data Source=Database\\TestData.sqlite * SQLite this does mean: * Run tests for `Access` configuration with default settings * Run tests for `SQLiteMs` configuration. This configuration is used as default, with connection string `Data Source=Database\\TestData.sqlite` and `SQLite` data provider. More examples are below in CI section. So tests are done only for providers defined in `DataProviders.txt`, defaults are in `DefaultDataProviders.txt` (they are Access, SQL CE, SQLite - all file server databases). To define your own configurations **DO NOT EDIT** `DefaultDataProviders.txt` - create `.\\Tests\\Linq\\UserDataProviders.txt` and define needed configurations. When all tests are executed, first `_CreateData` tests will be run - those execute SQL scripts and insert default data to database, so if you are going to run one test be sure to run `_CreateData` before it manually. Also - if your test changes database data, be sure to revert those changes (!) to avoid side effects for other tests. # Continuous Integration We do run builds and tests with: * [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/igor-tkachev/linq2db) (Windows) [appveyor.yml](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/appveyor.yml). Makes build and runs tests for: * .Net 4.5: [AppveyorDataProviders.txt](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/Tests/Linq/AppveyorDataProviders.txt) * .Net Core: [AppveyorDataProviders.Core.txt](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/Tests/Linq/AppveyorDataProviders.Core.txt) * [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/linq2db/linq2db) (Linux) [.travis.yml](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/.travis.yml). Makes build and runs tests for: * Mono: [TravisDataProviders.txt](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/Tests/Linq/TravisDataProviders.txt) * .Net Core: [TravisDataProviders.Core.txt](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/Tests/Linq/TravisDataProviders.Core.txt) `xxxDataproviders` files are renamed by CI to `UserDataProviders` before running tests. ## Skip CI build If you want to skip building commit by CI (for example you have changed *.md files only) begin commit comment with `[ci skip]`. ## Publishing packages * **Release candidate** packages are published by AppVeyor to [MyGet.org](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db#feeds) for each successful build of **master** branch. * **Release** packages are published by AppVeyor to [NuGet.org](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db#feeds) for each successful build of **release** branch. ## Building releases 1. Update `.\\NuGet\\Readme.txt` file (append release notes) 1. Create PR from `master` to `release` branch, in comments add [@testers](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/wiki/How-can-i-help#testing-how-to) to notify all testers that we are ready to release 1. Wait few days for feedback from testers and approval from contributors 1. Merge PR 1. [Tag release](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/releases) 1. Update versions in `master` branch (this will lead to publish all next `master` builds as new version RC): * in [.\\appveyor.yml](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/appveyor.yml) set `packageVersion` parameter * in [.\\Source\\project.json](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/Source/project.json) set new `version` parameter * in [.\\Source\\Properties\\LinqToDBConstants.cs](https://github.com/linq2db/linq2db/blob/master/Source/Properties/LinqToDBConstants.cs) set `FullVersionString` constant. # Process In general you should follow simple rules: * Development rules and regulations, code style * Do not add new features without tests * Avoid direct pushes to `master` and `release` branches * To fix some issue or implement new feature create new branch and make pull request after you are ready to merge. Merge your PR only after contributor's review. * If you are going to implement any big feature you may want other contributors to participate (coding, code review, feature discuss and so on), so to do it: * Create new PR with **[WIP]** prefix (Work In Process) * After you are ready to merge remove the prefix & assign contributors as reviewers * If you wo have wright access, it is recommended to use central repository (not forks). Why - simple, it would allow other teammates to help you in developing (if needed). Certainly you are free to use fork if it is more convenient to you * Please avoid adding new public classes, properties, methods without XML doc * Read issues and help users * Do not EF :) See also Issue reporting"

    "keywords": "Namespace LinqToDB.Mapping Classes AssociationAttribute Defines relation between tables or views. Could be applied to: instance properties and fields; instance and static methods. For associations, defined using static methods, this mapping side defined by type of first parameter. Also, optionally, you can pass data context object as extra method parameter. Based on association type - to one or to multiple records - result type should be target record's mapping type or System.IEquatable<T> collection. By default associations are used only for joins generation in LINQ queries and will have null value for loaded records. To load data into association, you should explicitly specify it in your query using LoadWith<T>(ITable<T>, Expression<Func<T, Object>>) method. AssociationDescriptor Stores association descriptor. ColumnAliasAttribute Specifies that current field or property is just an alias to another property or field. Currently this attribute has several issues: you can apply it to class or interface - such attribute will be ignored by linq2db; it is possible to define attribute without setting MemberName value; you can define alias to another alias property or field and potentially create loop. ColumnAttribute Configures mapping of mapping class member to database column. Could be applied directly to a property or field or to mapping class/interface. In latter case you should specify member name using MemberName property. ColumnDescriptor Stores mapping entity column descriptor. DataTypeAttribute This attribute allows to override default types, defined in mapping schema, for current column. Also see DataType and DbType . Applying this attribute to class or interface will have no effect. EntityDescriptor Stores mapping entity descriptor. EntityMappingBuilder<T> Fluent mapping entity builder. FluentMappingBuilder Fluent mapping builder. IdentityAttribute Marks target column as identity column with value, generated on database side during insert operations. Identity columns will be ignored for insert and update operations with implicit column list like Insert<T>(IDataContext, T, String, String, String) or Update<T>(IDataContext, T) methods. InheritanceMapping Stores inheritance mapping information for single discriminator value. InheritanceMappingAttribute Defines to which type linq2db should map record based on discriminator value. You can apply this attribute to a base class or insterface, implemented by all child classes. Don't forget to define discriminator value storage column using IsDiscriminator . MappingSchema Mapping schema. MapValue Stores enum mapping information for single enum value. MapValueAttribute Defines bidirectional mapping between enum field value, used on client and database value, stored in database and used in queries. Enumeration field could have multiple MapValueAttribute attributes. Mapping from database value to enumeration performed when you load data from database. Linq2db will search for enumeration field with MapValueAttribute with required value. If attribute with such value is not found, you will receive LinqToDBException error. If you cannot specify all possible values using MapValueAttribute , you can specify custom mapping using methods like SetConvertExpression<TFrom, TTo>(Expression<Func<TFrom, TTo>>, Boolean) . Mapping from enumeration value performed when you save it to database or use in query. If your enum field has multiple MapValueAttribute attributes, you should mark one of them as default using IsDefault property. NotColumnAttribute Marks current property or column to be ignored for mapping when explicit column mapping disabled. See IsColumnAttributeRequired . NotNullAttribute Sets nullability flag for current column to false . See NullableAttribute for more details. NullableAttribute Explicitly specifies that associated column could contain NULL values. Overrides default nullability flag from current mapping schema for property/field type. Has lower priority over CanBeNull . Using this attribute, you can allow NULL values for identity columns. PrimaryKeyAttribute Marks property or field as a member of primary key for current mapping type. PropertyMappingBuilder<T> Column or association fluent mapping builder. ScalarTypeAttribute Overrides default scalar detection for target class or structure. By default linq2db treats primitives and structs as scalar types. This attribute allows you to mark class or struct as scalar type or mark struct as non-scalar type. Also see IsStructIsScalarType . Note that if you marks some type as scalar, you will need to define custom mapping logic between object of that type and data parameter using SetConvertExpression(Type, Type, LambdaExpression, Boolean) methods. SequenceNameAttribute Specifies value generation sequence for mapped property of field. Currently it supported only for: Firebird generators; Oracle sequences. StoredProcedure This attribute is not used by linq2db and will be ignored. TableAttribute Maps databse table or view to a class or interface. You can apply it to any class including non-public, nester or abstract classes. Applying it to interfaces will allow you to perform queries against target table, but you need to specify projection in your query explicitly, if you want to select data from such mapping.

Supported values: - null for command without parameters; - single DataParameter instance; - array of DataParameter parameters; - mapping class entity. Last case will convert all mapped columns to DataParameter instances using following logic: - if column is of DataParameter type, column value will be used. If parameter name ( Name ) is not set, column name will be used; - if converter from column type to DataParameter is defined in mapping schema, it will be used to create parameter with colum name passed to converter; - otherwise column value will be converted to DataParameter using column name as parameter name and column value will be converted to parameter value using conversion, defined by mapping schema.
